Readme Documentation for Simple OpenAI Chatbot
=======================================

This code provides an example of how to implement an OpenAI chatbot using the OpenAI API and the `readline` module in Node.js. The chatbot uses the GPT-3 model to generate responses to user input.

Prerequisites
-------------

-   Node.js version 12.18.0 or later installed on your machine
-   An OpenAI API key. If you do not have an API key, you can sign up for one at <https://beta.openai.com/signup/>

Installation
------------

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  In the project directory, run the command `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3.  Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key as follows:

makefileCopy code

`API_KEY=<your-api-key>`

Usage
-----

To run the chatbot, use the command `node index.js` in the project directory. The chatbot will prompt you to enter a message, which will be sent to the OpenAI API for processing. The response generated by the GPT-3 model will be displayed in the console.

Customization
-------------

To customize the behavior of the chatbot, you can modify the `model` parameter in the `createChatCompletion` method to use a different GPT-3 model. You can also modify the messages array to include additional information about the user, such as their name or location.
